# 3d_kanye_project_processing
The project I produced after 2 weeks of coding in processing creating a magnum opus of art known as 3d kanye
its pretty simple it just uses processings rendering options to turn a 2d image into semi 3d image with depth
also to help to make it easier to show that the image has depth I just filled it using .get to use the original images colours
